We use galaxy.eu as our web-based ... Quality assurance



~~~~ DOWNLOAD SPADES OUTPUT: ~~~~

Type "spades" into tools search

Upload your reads (our reads for the demo are called reads1.fastq.gz and reads2.fastq.gz)

In spades, select "Paired-end: individual datasets"

For FASTA/FASTQ file(s): forward reads and FASTA/FASTQ file(s): reverse reads, select our reads demo files. Order doesn't matter.

Run on default settings.

Download results. (assembly graph, assembly Graph with scaffolds, Contigs, and Scaffolds) 
^^^ These are the files we will 



~~~~~ QUALITY CONTROL of SPADES OUTPUT: ~~~~~

Type QUAST in tools search

Under Assembly mode, select "individual assembly (1 contig file per sample)

Select scaffolds file that we have in Galaxy from the above demo. Because we are assessing the quality of Spades

Type of assembly: Genome
Use a reference genome: Yes

Go to NCBI and search for Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium 
(because that's just the genome we are working with for this demo)
(you can always use your scaffolds file to copy a chunk of the genome and BLAST it to confirm lol)

Download reference genome. Select FASTA (genome sequences) and GFF (annotation features) files.
(it downloads more files than you need. You just need the .fna and .gff files)

Go back to Galaxy.eu
Genome feature positions in the reference genome: upload our .gff file
Reference genome: upload our .fna file.

Operon positions in the reference genome; also use .gff
Are assemblies scaffolds rather than contigs?: yes
Is genome large: no (we know from our abyss output .csv file)
Tool for gene prediction: GeneMarkS if prokaryotes

Enables ribosomal RNA gene finding?: Yes

Enables search for Universal Single-Copy Orthologs using BUSCO: Yes

Check for PDF report output file

!!! RUN IT !!!

This gives us a report of how good our assembly was! Like, number of contigs, number of scaffolds, N50, L50.
Download PDF report. We are gonna compare this to our Abyss assembly.



~~~~~ QUALITY CONTROL OF ABYSS ASSEMBLY USING QUAST ~~~~~~

Upload your assembly from abyss. It's the file called salmonella-8.fa

The rest uses the same settings as above.



Compare the QA pdf outputs. Look @ N50, L50, (<want them to be big) (want them to be small>) number of contigs and scaffolds

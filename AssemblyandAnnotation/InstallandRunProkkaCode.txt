# run prokka, create a folder (directory), name it prokkaannotation, prefix gives files the prefix name of salmonella. 
# The last part is saying within the AbyssOutput folder, we want to annotate the file called salmonella-8.fa. (thats the scaffolds file)
prokka --outdir prokkaannotation --prefix salmonella AbyssOutput/salmonella-8.fa

#the .gst and .faa files are what we're interested in but they're hard to read. In stead, you can read salmonella.tsv file in excel. "hypothetical protein" is when they found a coding region, but dunno the protein it codes for or what it does.
